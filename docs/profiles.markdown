# Mélodie ■■■

![Portrait of Mélodie](/images/portraits/melodie512.png)

**Gender**: F<br>
**Age**: 20<br>
**Likes**: Honesty, humility, discovery. Her special scarf.<br>
**Dislikes**: Being alone for too long. Being around people for too long. Sleeping.<br>
<br>
A young wanderer, never staying in one place for long. A long, winding journey took her to the little town of Saint-Joel-De-Nulpart, where she's staying at for a while.<br>
<br>
To tell the truth, it's hard to get a good handle on her! Mélodie can appear so aloof.. And you notice the glean in her eyes, or she asks a question that betrays that, all along, she was paying attention to every word.<br>
<br>
Not one to talk much about herself, she prefers to learn about people as she goes, perhaps to dream up different pasts for herself...<br>
<br>
That's you, Mélodie!<br>
<br>
... Well, reading someone their profile is a little awkward. Did I get anything wrong?<br>

# Richard "The Storyteller" ■■■■■■■■■■

![Portrait of Richard](/images/portraits/storyteller512.png)

**Gender**: M<br>
**Age**: 43<br>
**Likes**: Reminiscing. A good cup of wine or two. Getting to work on a brand-new project.<br>
**Dislikes**: Actually finishing a project. Not having any decent public transit around.<br>
<br>
The writer of tonight's tale of Miracles and Magic, full of action and drama! 
<br>
It's often said that one is the worst judge of themselves, so I'll spare you my backstory here. Maybe one day, you'll get to fill these pages yourself!<br>
