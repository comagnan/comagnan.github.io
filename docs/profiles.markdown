# Mélodie ■■■

![Mirama](/images/portraits/melodie512.png)

Gender: F
Age: 20
Likes: Honesty, humility, discovery. Her special scarf.
Dislikes: Being alone for too long. Being around people for too long. Sleeping.

A young wanderer, never staying in one place for long. A long, winding journey took her to the little town of Saint-Joel-De-Nulpart, where she's staying at for a while.

To tell the truth, it's hard to get a good handle on her! Mélodie can appear so aloof.. And you notice the glean in her eyes, or she asks a question that betrays that, all along, she was paying attention to every word.

Not one to talk much about herself, she prefers to learn about people as she goes, perhaps to dream up different pasts for herself...

That's you, Mélodie!

... Well, reading someone their profile is a little awkward. Did I get anything wrong?
