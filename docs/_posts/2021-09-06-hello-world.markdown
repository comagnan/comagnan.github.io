What's this? I'm making a new blog, in the year of our lord 2021? Well, that's not really going to be the main focus on Mar√©e Haute.

I mainly wanted a reliable place to host the different things I make online, since I was being kind of all over the place. With this, I get to focus on my GitHub presence, and
have a pretty convenient page to visit all my projects as a result. Nifty!

Is the blog section going to be ignored entirely? No, that's not quite the plan. I have written blogs elsewhere already that might be worth bringing over, and I also plan to make
rare devlogs about my progress on current projects.

As of writing, this current project is Mirama, an bullet-dodging adventure game split between action levels in a medieval fantasy world, and world-building in the current day. It's way too early to offer anything more than a quick summary, but I'm sure that as progress gets done I'll be able to share fun tidbits about the game.

Look forward to it!
