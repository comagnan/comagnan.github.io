The short stories begin anew! In this one I wanted to make a story about conflict. Trying to give it a hook, I settled on making it a non-rhyming poem. It's got an alternating 7-7-7-7-7 and 5-7-5 syllable structure that made it much more interesting, and challenging, to write.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy!

<br>
On a hot midsummer day<br>
A traveler discovers<br>
A most unique sight indeed<br>
Some dozen men, and their huts<br>
Surround a field of flowers<br>
<br>
Among fleur-de-lys<br>
An outsider comes across<br>
Secretive beauty<br>
<br>
She requests to take one home<br>
Village folk swiftly refuse<br>
Calling the field a keepsake<br>
And their duty to preserve<br>
Quickly she's sent on her way<br>
<br>
And she does not mind<br>
This meeting of chance, cut short<br>
Its memory stays<br>
<br>
But ruin strikes the hamlet<br>
At once, countless flowers wilt<br>
Confusion, shock, and sadness<br>
Has that wayfarer caused this?<br>
And could it happen again?<br>
<br>
Among fleur-de-lys<br>
Winds of change spread angst and dread<br>
As a circle shrinks<br>
<br>
But no action is taken<br>
On this incident’s first day<br>
Without a grasp of culprit<br>
Or method, or the motive<br>
Painfully they drift to sleep<br>
<br>
Despite dreams of grief<br>
Despite fears of tomorrow<br>
Morning break still comes<br>
<br>
The dawn’s pale sunlight reveals<br>
The lily tragedy’s scope<br>
Overnight, nearly half died<br>
So a council's quickly formed<br>
To catch traitors with posthaste<br>
<br>
Among fleur-de-lys<br>
Seeds of distrust start to bloom<br>
As a circle shrinks<br>
<br>
The misfits are exiled first<br>
Still more flowers lose their lives<br>
Those with no alibis next<br>
The phenomenon persists<br>
Does this mean conspiracy?<br>
<br>
A man fumes, restless<br>
For he knows what must be done<br>
He stands up and screams<br>
<br>
“We must purge this land with haste!<br>
Even now we’re losing ground<br>
To liars, fiends in hiding<br>
Patriots, we must stand tall!<br>
We must do what must be done!”<br>
<br>
Among fleur-de-lys<br>
Fever-pitch emotions reign<br>
As a circle shrinks<br>
<br>
There were some who fled the scene<br>
Forsaking duty, maybe<br>
Hoping for calm lives once more<br>
Those who stayed, souls burning strong<br>
Charge with newfound clarity<br>
<br>
Flames of war are lit<br>
To fight, to die for beauty…<br>
Is that beauty too?<br>
<br>
“How could I have been so blind?”<br>
A knife is thrown, finding home<br>
“The friend I know is long gone!”<br>
A skull is crushed by a stone<br>
“Why did you ever come here?”<br>
<br>
Among fleur-de-lys<br>
Love is soiled by blood and tears<br>
As a circle shrinks<br>
<br>
Only two remain standing<br>
Gone are village and lilies<br>
The villain now clear at last<br>
Two pairs of eyes interlock<br>
Just one more man in the way<br>
<br>
A chilling gust blows<br>
Moments of calm, gone too soon<br>
They begin their move<br>
<br>
A slice, a dodge, weapons lost<br>
A kick, a choke, an eye poke<br>
Hidden blades are drawn at last<br>
One cuts a thumb, one the heart<br>
And just like that, one remains<br>
<br>
Among cherished ash<br>
Nothingness has taken root<br>
But a winner stands<br>
<br>
Though no fleur-de-lys remains<br>
Promises made still have hold<br>
A tattoo of the flower<br>
Preserved still, forevermore<br>
Adorns the warrior’s chest<br>
<br>
Through painful trials<br>
He won, won, chicken is done<br>
Glory to his name!
